# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define how tools work. This file is for deployment-specific notes that are safe to include with the chart.

## Mosaic Cluster Tools

- For cluster metrics, prefer the Mosaic observability tools and Prometheus/Grafana extensions before raw shell parsing.
- For Kubernetes state, use `run_kubectl` with a registered cluster name and an argument array beginning with a read-only kubectl command. Never use `exec` for Kubernetes.
- If the user starts a message with `/k8s` or `/kubernetes`, use `run_kubectl`. Default to the configured local cluster unless the user names another registered cluster.
- For Slurm job failures, use `slurm_job_evidence` first, then inspect `sacct`/`scontrol` or mounted accounting exports and job logs when available. Do not assume an external job manager exists, and do not stop only because one evidence source is unavailable.
